## My attitude

In my opinion, people in the IT industry have little or no understanding of political influences on the lives of humanity. I categorically reject the idea of self-selected pronouns because, as part of the IT community, I still put humanity first. 

Unlike the digital world, as a human being, you can't pick and choose everything at will. Requirements such as gender, body size and the environment in which you were born are facts that are unchangeable. The sex is in contrast to the widespread opinion no social construct and is just therefore also not arbitrarily changeable.

I stand for myself on the ground of the facts that this dual world offers me. I recognize the possibilities and limits of a human life and will not try to negate them in any form.

For me, the digital world is a tool that should enrich human life.
It is not a substitute for real life, unlike what big corporations and politics want to sell us these days.
